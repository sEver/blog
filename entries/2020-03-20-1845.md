    Today they stopped counting the dead.
    Is this the end of days. 
    Have you used your time well?
    
Over a quarter of a million infected that we have tested, unknown legions of those who haven't been.

How fragile was this construct of ours. Civilization on the brink. Systems so unstable... 
economies that had the capacity to choke on their own processess, do not react better now,
when they have a Reason. 

People out of work, out of hope. In fear. 

People with not enough discipline to even stay home and take things seriously. 
We got so used to lies in the media, we do not believe them when they're warning us of Death.

POTUS tries to buy the vaccine, while it's in the works, for use in the US exclusively.
How is this not an act of war on the world?
Restricting the medicine is just another way of killing people. 

We thought about the Apocalypse, fire and brimstone raining from the skies.
Never did we imagine, it would be playing itself out silently, while we watch Netflix in our Pyjamas.

Message ends.
